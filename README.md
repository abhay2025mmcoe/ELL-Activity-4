Create an employee database using structure and display info. Design a C program to display the information of all employees in a company sorted by their salaries from highest to lowest . each employee info including their employee id and salary is stored in database using arrays and structures the program should read employee data from database , organise it based on salaries and then print details of each employee in descending order of their salaries additionally program should handle ties in salary and provide a consistent method for sorting the employees.


🔹  Subject
The subject is the individual or group performing the activity.
In this case, the subject is the programmer or student writing and executing the C program to manage employee data.
🔹 Object
The object is the goal or problem space the subject is working on.
The object here is to organize and display employee information (ID, name, salary) in descending order of salary, using structured programming.
🔹 Tools (Instruments)
These are the mediating artifacts used to achieve the object.
The tools include:
C programming language
Structures (struct) to model employee data
Arrays to store multiple employees
Sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort) to order data
Input/output functions (scanf, printf) for interaction
These tools mediate the subject’s interaction with the object.
🔹 Rules
Rules are the norms, constraints, or conventions governing the activity.
In this context:
C syntax and semantics
Logical rules for sorting (e.g., descending salary, tie-breaking by ID)
Input validation and formatting standards
These rules ensure the program behaves predictably and correctly.
🔹  Community
The community includes all stakeholders involved in or affected by the activity.
This may include:
Students and educators using the program for learning
Developers maintaining the code
Organizations using similar logic in real-world HR systems


🔹 Division of Labor
This refers to how tasks are distributed among participants or components.
In this program:
The user inputs employee data
The program handles storage, sorting, and output
The compiler translates code into executable instructions
🔹  Outcome
The outcome is the final result of the activity.
The outcome is a sorted list of employees displayed in descending order of salary, enabling better decision-making or analysis
